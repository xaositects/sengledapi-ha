# Home Assistant - Sengled Bulb Integration

This is a custom component to allow control of Sengled Bulbs in Homeassistant using the unofficial Sengled API. Please note this mimics the Sengled app and therefore Sengled may cut off access at anytime.

# Supported Bulbs from Sengled
You can find [Supported Products](https://github.com/xaositects/ha-sengledapi/wiki) here. If you have other bulbs that are not on this list and they do work, you can create a pull request to have the wiki updated.

**The goal is to support all Sengled Bulbs so feel free to buy me coffee.

### Highlights of what **SengledApi** can do

* Control Sengled Bulbs as lights through HA
* Control Sengled Light Switch through HA

### Potential Downsides

* This is an unofficial implementation of the api and therefore may be disabled or broken at anytime by Sengled
* I only have Element Classic A19 Kit (Light bulbs + Hub) https://us.sengled.com/products/element-classic-kit and the Wifi LED Multicolor A19 Bulb https://us.sengled.com/products/sengled-smart-wi-fi-led-multicolor-a19-bulb to test.

* An update from Sengled may break this integration without my knowledge. **Please use the betas as they become avaliable**

** Wifi bulbs are supported by adding ```wifi: true``` to your configuration. All functions should be supported.
